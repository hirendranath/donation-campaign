# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# This is My Course Project

## My project has a few features.

## Features
- Each Donation Card features a unique color scheme, including varying background colors, text colors, and button colors. This visual diversity enhances the user experience and makes each fund stand out.
Consistent Color Coherence:

- On the fund details page, users encounter a "Donate" button whose background color matches the category and title text color. This design choice creates a cohesive and visually appealing interface.
One-Time Donation Limitation:

- Users are restricted from making duplicate donations to the same fund. This ensures that each user contributes to a fund only once, preventing accidental or intentional duplicate donations.
Comprehensive Donation Statistics:

- The statistics page features a pie chart that provides users with a visual representation of their contributions. Users can easily gauge what percentage of the total donations they have made relative to their total contributions. This chart fosters transparency and encourages continued support.
These features combine to create an engaging and user-friendly donation platform that promotes transparency, consistency, and meaningful contributions to various causes.

## How I will manage my project state by using react useState.

- Plan the React components you'll need for the feature.
- Break down the feature into smaller tasks or user stories.
- Utilize React state and props to manage data and component interactions.
